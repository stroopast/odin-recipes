    <h2 class="smalltitleh2">Ingredients</h2>
    <h3 class="smalltitleh3">Meatballs</h3>
    <ul>12 wooden skewers, 3 to 4 inches long</ul>
    <ul>1 pound 5 ounces lean ground beef</ul>
    <ul>1 large egg, lightly beaten</ul>
    <ul>7 tablespoons Italian seasoned bread crumbs</ul>
    <ul>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
    <ul>1/2 red onion, grated</ul>
    <ul>4 teaspoons garlic paste</ul>
    <ul>2 1/2 teaspoons salt</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon dried oregano</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon dried parsley</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon dried basil</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon red chili flakes (optional)</ul>
    <h3 class="smalltitleh3">Filling and Coating</h3>
    <ul>24 (1 inch) cubes mozzarella cheese</ul>
    <ul>1 (12.4 ounce) can pizza crust dough, such as PillsburyÂ®</ul>
    <ul>5 tablespoons butter, melted</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon garlic paste</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley</ul>
    <ul>1 cup marinara sauce, or as needed, for dipping</ul>
    <h2 class="smalltitleh2">Steps</h2>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
        Place skewers in water to soak. 
        Line a sheet pan with parchment paper</li>
    <li>For meatballs, combine beef, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, onion, garlic paste, salt, oregano, parsley, basil, and chili flakes in a large bowl until evenly mixed</li>    
    <li>Weigh out 1.13 ounces of mixture and form it around 1 mozzarella cube. Roll in hands to ensure a tight seal. 
        Place meatball on prepared pan; repeat with remaining mozzarella and meatball mixture to make 24 balls</li>
    <li>On a lightly floured cutting board or other work surface, roll out pizza dough. 
        Slice into 12 even strips</li>
    <li>Place 2 meatballs on the work surface and coil 1 strip around them, alternating sides to form an S. 
        Use finger tips to hold down the first meatball and gently insert the skewer through it and the dough, twisting the skewer slightly until it comes out the other end</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, combine melted butter, garlic and parsley. 
        Using a pastry brush, brush the butter mixture over dough</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. 
        Serve with warmed marinara sauce</li>

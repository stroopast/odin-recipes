    <h2 class="smalltitleh2">Description</h2>
    <p>This Philly cheesesteak dip would make a handsome addition to your snack table for the Big Game. 
        Like all great party foods, it's wonderful hot, warm, room temp, and, I've heard from a reliable source, even delicious cold. 
        Serve alongside sliced baguette.
        Keep it hot and fresh for guests by baking it in 2 batches, or feel free to do this all at once in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
    <h2 class="smalltitleh2">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>1 pound beef top sirloin steaks</ul>
    <ul>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon olive oil</ul>
    <ul>1 yellow onion, diced</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon butter</ul>
    <ul>1 red bell pepper</ul>
    <ul>1 green bell pepper</ul>
    <ul>½ cup pepperoncini peppers</ul>
    <ul>7 pickled red peppers (such as Peppadew®)</ul>
    <ul>3 jalapeño peppers</ul>
    <ul>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</ul>
    <ul>½ pound provolone cheese</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</ul>
    <ul>1 pinch cayenne pepper</ul>
    <h2 class="smalltitleh2">Steps</h2>
    <li>Slice steak into thick pieces. Season generously on both sides with salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a pan over high heat until smoking. Add steak slices and sear until bottoms are browned, 3 to 4 minutes. 
        Flip over and reduce heat to medium. Cook until juices appear on the tops, 3 to 4 minutes more. 
        Transfer to a bowl to cool</li>
    <li>Add diced onion, a big pinch of salt, and butter to the meat juices in the pan. 
        Cook and stir over medium heat, scraping up the browned bits, until onions start to soften, 5 to 7 minutes</li>
    <li>Dice up the red bell pepper, green bell pepper, pepperoncini, pickled red peppers, and jalapenos until you have 1 1/2 to 2 cups. 
        Add to the onions; cook and stir until starting to soften, about 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
    <li>Chop steak into small pieces. Place back into the bowl with the accumulated meat juices. Add the onion-pepper mixture and cream cheese. 
        Grate in the provolone cheese, saving a little for the top. Drizzle in Worcestershire sauce and sprinkle in cayenne pepper. 
        Mix dip thoroughly</li>
    <li>Transfer 1/2 of the dip into a small baking dish. Smooth the top with a fork. Place baking dish on top of a sheet pan. 
        Sprinkle the remaining provolone cheese on top. Save the other 1/2 to bake fresh for your guests</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dip is bubbling and heated through, 20 to 25 minutes. Broil until top is browned, about 1 minute more. 
        Repeat with the second batch of dip</li>
